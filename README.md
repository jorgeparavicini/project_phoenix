# Project Phoenix

This project is a proof of concept for a VR Application made in Unity.
The idea behind this game was to incentivize young people to join in IT-Programmes when they could see first hand what they could be doing a few years in.

This game contains multiple levels where each is based inside a postal sorting center. For example, in one level the player has to sort the packages into the right container as fast as posible without placing packages in the wrong containers.
The levels are mostly score and time based, where you have to get as many points as posible in a given time frame.
